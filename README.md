# phantomas-report-server

A very basic server for hosting [phantomas](https://github.com/macbre/phantomas) reports as generated by [grunt-phantomas](https://github.com/stefanjudis/grunt-phantomas). While you can setup more advanced phantomas reporting with its built-in support for statsd, the reports generated by `grunt-phantomas` are intuitive and easy to generate. This project is little more than a generic web server that can host `grunt-phantomas` reports.
